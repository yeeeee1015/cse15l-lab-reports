Exact keys I pressed: ```ssh cs15lwi23apc@ieng6.ucsd.edu```

This command logs me into ieng6. 
## Step 5:

### Clone the repo from the Github account

Exact keys I pressed: ```git clone <ctrl v>```

The url ```https://github.com/yeeeee1015/lab7``` was copied, so I used 
control v, the paste command, to quickly get it typed.

The rest of the command clones the url, which is the forked lab7 repository.
