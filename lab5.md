# **Copy Commands**

---

## **Command 1: cp -v (verbose)**

---

The first command-line option that we are looking at is -v, or verbose. This option describes what our copy command is doing. It writes the file that is being copied, and it points an arrow (->) to the directory it is being copied to.

### Syntax:
```
cp -v [Source] [Directory]
```
### Example 1:

```
cd travel_guides
$ cp -v berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt berlitz1
'berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt' -> 'berlitz1/Bahamas-History.txt'
```
In this example, the source I'm copying (Bahamas-History.txt) and the directory I'm copying it to (berlitz1) are both written in the terminal by the command.

### Example 2:

```
cd travel_guides
$ cp -v berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt ../non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch1.txt
'berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt' -> '../non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch1.txt'
```
In this example, the source I'm copying (Bahamas-History.txt) and the source I'm copying it to (ch1.txt) are both written in the terminal by the command. ch1.txt's contents turn into Bahamas-History.txt's contents.

## **Command 2: cp -u (update)**

---

The next command-line option that we are looking at is -u, or update. This option only copies when the source file we're copying is newer than the destination directory or file. Essentially, it allows us to update files.

### Syntax:
```
cp -u [Source] [Directory]
```
