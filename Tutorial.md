Visit this link (https://code.visualstudio.com) and choose the platform that you are on (Mac, Linux, Windows)

After it is successfully installed, you should be able to open VS code and see something like this:

**Step 2: Connecting**

Visit this link (https://gitforwindows.org/) to install Git Bash for Windows. Once it's installed, we have to set it as the default terminal in VS Code.
1. Open the Terminal (Ctrl + ')
2. Open the command palette (Ctrl + Shift + P)
3. Type "Select Default Profile"
4. Select "Git Bash" 
5. Click on the + icon directly to the right of the terminal.

Now that Git Bash is your default terminal, let's connect to the remote server. To do this, visit https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php. Log into your UCSD account by inputting your username and Student ID. Once you're logged in, you should see this page.

Write down the three letters that are boxed in the picture (your letters are different). Then click on the boxed link.
Now, click the link that says "change your password". Enter your current and new passwords, and when finished, DON'T click the check your password button. Instead, simply click return/enter on your keyboard when your cursor is selecting the new password field.
