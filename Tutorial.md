**Step 2: Connecting**

Visit this link (https://gitforwindows.org/) to install Git Bash for Windows. Once it's installed, we have to set it as the default terminal in VS Code.
1. Open the Terminal (Ctrl + ')
2. Open the command palette (Ctrl + Shift + P)
3. Type "Select Default Profile"
4. Select "Git Bash" 
5. Click on the + icon directly to the right of the terminal.

Now that Git Bash is your default terminal, let's connect to the remote server. To do this, carefully follow the instructions in this tutorial (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hs7CyQeh-MdUfM9uv99i8tqfneos6Y8bDU0uhn1wqho/edit) to reset your password.
